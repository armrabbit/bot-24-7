## 📝Introduction

Tweetcord is a Discord bot that leverages the [tweety-ns module](https://github.com/mahrtayyab/tweety) to provide real-time tweet updates from specific Twitter users directly to your Discord server. Simply configure the Twitter users and Discord channels you want to monitor, and Tweetcord will automatically forward tweets to the designated channels, ensuring you never miss important updates.🐦

## ⚡Usage

**📢This tutorial is suitable for version 0.3.2 or later. (Recommended: 0.3.5 or later)**
